/**
  Enummeration of all trust policy validation types.
 
  - disabled:           Perform no validation at all.
                        Be careful, this will always consider any server trust as valid.
 
  - standard:           Perform a standard validation.
                        Using the system provided standard mechanism that is basically a
                        X.509 certificate trust evaluation in a recursive two-step
                        process down to the trusted anchor certificate.

 - custom:              Perform a completely custom validation.
                        The validation process is completely up to you.
 
 - pinCertificate:      Perform a validation by pinning certificate(s).
                        The validation process is considered successful if one of the pinned
                        certificates match one of the servers certificates and standard
                        validation has also been successful.
 
 - pinPublicKey:        Perform a validation by pinning the certificate(s) public key.
                        The validation process is considered successful if one of the pinned
                        public key(s) match one of the servers public key(s) and standard
                        validation has also been successful.
 
- pinCertificateOnline: Perform a validation by pinning certificate(s).
                        The validation process is considered successful if one of the pinned
                        certificates match one of the servers certificates and standard
                        validation has also been successful. The Pinning certificates are 
                        downloaded from a trusted third party.
 
- pinPublicKeyOnline:   Perform a validation by pinning the certificate(s) public key.
                        The validation process is considered successful if one of the pinned
                        public key(s) match one of the servers public key(s) and standard
                        validation has also been successful. The Pinning certificates are
                        downloaded from a trusted third party.
